# Postman - Imgur - Collection
I have created this collection based on the Imgur REST API, which allows users to upload, share, and manage their images and galleries on Imgur.
The Imgur REST API is a set of web-based interfaces that allow developers to interact with the Imgur platform programmatically. It provides endpoints for uploading images, creating albums and galleries, searching for images, and managing user accounts and settings.

#### I have also created a visualization of the API requests flow and generated a report for my collection using the Newman tool.
